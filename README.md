This was my final project for my machine dynamics class. The class was focused on a pratical approach to Lagrangian mechanics. I made the game "Angry Birds Space." 

All the physics simulations are written by myself. I don't use an existing game engine. 

I suggest using Juypter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to run the game. The code takes a few minutes to run, since efficiency wasn't a high priority.
